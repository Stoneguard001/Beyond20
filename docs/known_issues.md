Some issues are already known and being worked on.

- Hotkeys seem to not work when using Shift at the same time. This is because `Shift-a` for example makes it `A` instead of `a`, you can set two hotkeys for the same action, one for the lowercase and one for the uppercase letter (press Caps-lock before configuring the new key)
- Using Bless/Guidance hotkeys will fail and show a `0` result in Roll20 when not using Digital Dice. As a workaround, set your Custom roll bonus to `0` in the character's settings.

To check the latest list of known issues or feature suggestions, you can head to the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/kakaroto/Beyond20/issues).

If you find an issue that isn't in the list (check the closed ones for the next milestone too), I'd appreciate you letting me know about it (either by [creating one](https://github.com/kakaroto/Beyond20/issues/new), or by reaching out to me over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZAasSVS)!
